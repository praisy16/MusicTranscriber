# MusicTranscriber

MusicTranscriber is a Python program that converts a song into musical notes for the bansuri flute in sargam notation. It extracts the melody from an audio file, converts the pitches to Western notes, maps them to sargam notation, and adjusts for octaves.

## Motivation
As a flute player, I often found it challenging to locate musical notes for songs I wanted to play. Unlike other instruments, resources for bansuri flute notations in sargam are scarce. To bridge this gap, I created MusicTranscriber. This tool enables bansuri enthusiasts to transcribe any song into sargam notation, making it easier to play their favorite tunes on the flute.

## Features
- Extracts melody from audio files
- Converts Western musical notes to sargam notation
- Adjusts notes for different octaves
- Outputs sargam notation to a text file
